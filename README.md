## Introduction 

Batman's Rogues Gallery is a UI Modal interface featuring some of the most famous (and some not so famous) villains of Gotham City.

## Prerequisites

The gallery is best viewed in the Google Chrome browser.

## Installation

To install the gallery, download all repo files to your computer. Be sure to save them in the same directory (aka folder).

Open index.html in Chrome.

## How it Works

To interact with the gallery, hover over the card featuring the villain about whom you would like more information and click the card. A modal with more detail about the villain will display. 

To close the modal, click the "X" at the top right of the modal or simply click anywhere inside the computer terminal.
